- Possible alternative way rather than dests.visited? 

- 32kb / 64kb isn't necessarily enough to send all latest data
    - Since file_seeders is unbounded and latest_messages are technically
      also unbounded, this could result in the latest just not sending
    - Possible to unbound max_message_size in webrtc-rs
    - This case, it's possible to just push a huge list of messages
        - This would be good for "atomic" messages where it the 
          only thing that matters is whether user gets this message
    - Possibly change latestMessage to send 32kb (use encoded_len)
        - Allows a larger size of characters
