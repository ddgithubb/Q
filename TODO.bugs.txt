- Possible alternative way rather than dests.visited? 

- Chunksmissing will fire at the beginning if there is congestion
    - How to not do this as it will cause more congestion WITHOUT removing chunksMissing request
        - Because then if the node offerer never got the request, it'll never send
        - IT also wouldn't be helpful to delay the chunksMissing timer (same problem)
    - Need a congestion detector to accomodate/predict whether or not node has gotten the request

- Also seems to be a bit of blocking going on SOMETIMES when getting from cache
    - Unknown if the cache is what's causing it, but never happens without cache

- Remove all "as ___" that isn't casting
- Sync server websocket write concurrency error
    - Should be fixed
- Better aggregation to reduce code in pool-client
