- QUIC

    - Supports mutiplexing
    - Need to configure heartbeat
    - One connection allows for hole punching once?
        - False, NAT mapping still needs to send to dest
    - Need to test against new WebRTC-rs updates
    - Need custom TLS logic apparently

- Custom hole-punching:
    - Need to be careful of Ipv4/Ipv6 (just need a flag differentiator)
    - Use google stun servers for now
        - Actaully probably no need?
        - I don't know how remote port changes depending
          on endpoint
    - https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/relay/DCUtR.md
        - My guess is use UDP for client "B" to send these packets
          and then once connected, stop sending packets
    - Possibly implement https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/id/draft-takeda-symmetric-nat-traversal-00.txt
